            <h1>Hi I'm Stephen !</h1>
            <div id="info">
                <p>I am a rising high school junior with an interest in the intersection of computer science and social justice. Throughout my high school
                    career, I have been involved with several clubs within my club that focused on bringing awareness to the issues of different marginalized 
                    communities. This along with my passion for coding led me to the discovery of the field of artificial intelligence, an industry I would like 
                    to pursue a carrer in. In my free time, I enjoy mindlessly scrolling through Pinterest and listening to new music artists!

                <p class="info">Bias Chat was an app design pitch to address the issues of biases and help individuals recognize them
                    and educate themselves on how to correct their biases. This educational app tracks the user's progress and provides suggestions on articles and quizzes the 
                    user should look into next.

                <p class="info">This website was one of my projects I had in my computer science class at school. The main curriculum at my school is the International Baccalaureate curriculum. This project was created
                    to educate myself and my peers on the classes and diploma requirements we would be participating in for the next two years.
