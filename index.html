            <h1>Hi I'm Stephen !</h1>
            <div id="info">
                <p>I am a rising high school junior with an interest in the intersection of computer science and social justice. Throughout my high school
                    career, I have been involved with several clubs within my club that focused on bringing awareness to the issues of different marginalized 
                    communities. This along with my passion for coding led me to the discovery of the field of artificial intelligence, an industry I would like 
                    to pursue a carrer in. In my free time, I enjoy mindlessly scrolling through Pinterest and listening to new music artists!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My activsm includes canvassing for New York State Assemblymember Yuh Line Niou and interning with the Stop AAPI Hate Youth Campaign. Aside from 
                    my volunteering with these organizations, I am a student at All Star Code's Summer Intensive and have attended Mouse Design League in the past.
                    More of my experiences can be found on my Linkedin!
